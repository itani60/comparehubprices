    <div class="section">
        <span class="question-label">Question 1: The Intro</span>
        <h2>"Tell us about your product"</h2>
        <div class="strategy-box"><strong>Strategy:</strong> Pitch the business value clearly. Show it's a real
            platform, not just a toy.</div>
        <div class="answer-box">
            "I built <strong>CompareHubPrices</strong>, a price comparison platform for South Africa. <br><br>
            Users can <strong class='highlight'>search for products</strong> and compare prices from different stores
            nationwide to find the best deals. The platform includes <strong class='highlight'>Price Alerts</strong>
            where users set alerts on products and get notified through <strong>browser notifications or email</strong>
            when prices drop. We also have a <strong class='highlight'>Wishlist feature</strong> where users can enable
            a setting to automatically add all wishlist products to price alerts,
            so they never miss a deal on items they're tracking.<br><br>
            We're also launching <strong class='highlight'>LocalHub</strong> - a dedicated platform within
            CompareHubPrices
            that allows legitimate small businesses to advertise and be seen nationwide. Business users can engage with
            their followers, collect ratings and reviews, and <strong>access analytics</strong> to understand their
            base and product performance. LocalHub empowers service-based small businesses - like caterers, salons,
            restaurants, gift hamper creators, wedding dress designers, and card makers - to grow their reach and
            connect
            with customers nationwide.<br><br>
            The platform also includes a <strong class='highlight'>comprehensive admin management system</strong> for
            overseeing platform operations:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Product Catalogs:</strong> Bulk imports and price updates</li>
                <li><strong>User Accounts & Business Accounts:</strong> Managing users, handling reports and support
                    tickets</li>
                <li><strong>Business Verification:</strong> Verifying and approving business posts before they go live
                    on LocalHub,
                    handling reports against businesses (fraud, harassment, illegitimate activities)</li>
                <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> Tracking user activity, logins, and business performance</li>
                <li><strong>Content Moderation:</strong> Reviewing posts, articles, and reviews</li>
                <li><strong>Platform Monitoring:</strong> System health checks and audit logs</li>

    <div class="section">
        <span class="question-label">Question 2: The Setup</span>
        <h2>"What is your current tech stack?"</h2>
        <div class="strategy-box"><strong>Strategy:</strong> Set the stage for the migration. Mention specific AWS
            services.</div>
        <div class="answer-box">
            "Right now, I'm fully on <strong>AWS Serverless</strong>.<br>
            I'm using <span class='pain-point'>DynamoDB</span> for data, <span class='pain-point'>Cognito</span> for
            auth, and heavily relying on <span class='pain-point'>Lambda</span> functions for even simple logic.<br><br>
            However, the <span class='pain-point'>unpredictable costs are a nightmare</span>. I set minimum budgets for
            monthly testing, but <span class='pain-point'>DynamoDB</span> charges me heavily once my free tier usage
            limit is finished. <br><br>
            I had to backup my data and <strong>delete 50 DynamoDB tables</strong> to stop the bleeding. I kept only the
            Lambdas, thinking that would solve it. But I was <span class='pain-point'>still getting charged</span> even
            though I wasn't actively using the services. I also made costly mistakes early on - using <strong>scan
                instead
                of query</strong> which racked up charges quickly until I learned to optimize.<br><br>
            As an unemployed developer, these unexpected bills force me to dip into savings or ask family for help to
            pay
            AWS bills. I need a more predictable, affordable solution."

    <!-- Question 3 -->
    <div class="section">
        <span class="question-label">Question 3: The Pitch (Crucial)</span>
        <h2>"Why do you want to switch to Supabase?"</h2>
        <div class="strategy-box"><strong>Strategy:</strong> Contrast AWS pain with Supabase benefits. They love hearing
            this.</div>
        <div class="answer-box">
            "I spend too much time managing IAM roles and debugging NoSQL schemas. I want Supabase because:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Relational Data:</strong> I need Postgres. Managing complex relationships in DynamoDB is
                    slowing me down.</li>
                <li><strong>Client-Side Fetching:</strong> I want to query data directly from my frontend using your JS
                    client, instead of writing hundreds of middleware Lambdas.</li>
                <li><strong>Auth:</strong> I need an authentication system that just works out of the box, unlike
                    Cognito.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            But honestly, <span class='highlight'>the real reason is funding</span>. Even after optimizing everything, I
            don't
            see myself running my website on AWS because of lack of funds. I actually <strong>like the AWS
                interface</strong>
            and have had many thoughts about staying, but I'm now in the <strong>final stages of deployment</strong> and
            starting to realize that using AWS might make me fail due to lack of funding. <br><br>
            I need Supabase to actually <strong>launch this platform</strong> and give it a fighting chance.<br><br>
            I'll be honest with you - <span class='highlight'>$300 in credits would make a huge difference to me</span>.
            I still have to register my business too. Covering me for 12 months gives me the chance to look for funding
            or
            save a $300 budget allocated for Supabase. It also reduces my stress tremendously.<br><br>
            I want to turn this into reality, and <strong>you guys are my only hope</strong>. I might be an amateur with
            less experience coming to you, but I'm coming with <strong>honesty</strong> and asking for help to turn my
            dream into reality."

        <div class="answer-box">

                queries</strong>.<br><br>
            For LocalHub, businesses upload their service offerings and engage with customers. We need robust database

            "One of our core retention features is <strong>Chat between Shoppers and Store Owners</strong>.<br><br>

            With Supabase, I can simply <strong>subscribe to the `messages` table</strong> using Realtime. Only the
            receiver gets the message (thanks to RLS). This architectural simplification alone is worth the migration."
